<h1> Membership Management Project </h1>
<p> Given a few classes, this project, using object-oriented programming, is made to manage the subscribers of a service. </p>
<p>The number of premium subscribers is calculated, and a method is implemented to find the total amount of money collected from all subscribers, assuming that the period is represented as the number of months and the price is paid monthly. </p>

<p> The Customers class is implemented to store a list of Subscriber objects. The Subscriber class has attributes such as name, subscription type, and subscription duration. The Customers class has a method that iterates through the list of subscribers and returns the count of premium subscribers. </p>

<p>The class also has a method that calculates the total revenue collected from all subscribers; it iterates through the list of subscribers, calculates the subscription price based on the subscription type and duration, and adds it to a running total. </p>

<p>Overall, the Customers class provides a way to manage and analyze the subscribers, and the implemented methods allow for easy calculation of important metrics such as the number of premium subscribers and total revenue collected. </p>
